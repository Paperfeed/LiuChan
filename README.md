## LiuChan Chinese Popup Dictionary
LiuChan (*liú chàng*) is an extension for chrome that allows you to mouse-over Chinese to instantly lookup the dictionary.

It started out as a port of RikaiChan (and its Rikai derivatives) and has since grown into a sleek and functionality centered plugin that holds its own.

#### Current Features & To Do

* Instantaneous translation of Chinese characters and words on mouse over
* Synchronized settings across all your devices
* Text input support
* Theme support

**TO DO**

- [ ] Add word lists/Anki support
- [ ] Improve performance (more!)
- [ ] Add omnibox fuzzy search (pinyin/hanzi)
- [x] Update CEDICT

#### Why is it called LiuChan?
流畅 (*liú chàng*) stands for fluency in a language. I kept -Chan as an homage to it's origin.
