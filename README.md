LiuChan (*liú chàng*) is a mouse-over Chinese pop up dictionary for Chrome.

It started out as a port of RikaiChan (and its Rikai derivatives) and has since grown into a sleek and functionality centered plugin that holds its own.

#### Why is it called LiuChan?
流畅 (*liú chàng*) stands for fluency in a language. I kept -Chan as an homage to it's origin.
